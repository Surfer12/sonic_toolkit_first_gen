rules, boxes, and the big game

most people think the boxes around them are permanent, but they're just constructs. rules exist everywhere and yes, you need to learn them first — but most are just little games pretending to be the big game.

if you're just starting out, you're going to feel like everyone else knows some secret rulebook you don't have. they don't. they're just playing by someone else's rules and calling it wisdom.

the little games? metrics obsession, design system orthodoxy, bureaucracy trying to feel important. the big game is more about creating meaning, beauty, and helping humans flourish. you get to choose which one you play.

i've watched teams spend weeks chasing a 2% conversion bump while their users are literally screaming that the product sucks. i've seen designers torture themselves making 12px work when 10px feels perfect, all because the style guide said so. i’ve seen endless ideas die just because they don’t match some conventional wisdom.

but here's the thing — the best work comes from trusting yourself. every breakthrough i've seen happened when someone said "this feels wrong" and had the courage to try something different. they know when to bend the rules and jump out of it.

learn the rules first, understand why they exist. then trust your gut and break them when they don't serve you. eventually you'll be making new rules that others follow. it's like learning music or color theory so you can break it beautifully — the rules teach you the language, but your instincts know the poetry.

your uncertainty isn't weakness, it's potential. when you can tell the difference between little games and the big game, you're free to create something that actually matters. don't get stuck in boxes someone else built for their problems.
