Quick status: You’re right that once we’re choosing among discrete alternatives, rules and MCDA belong. I’ll reconcile that with Ψ by showing how they compose and when our invariance results still apply.
Reconciliation in one view
Rules (hard constraints): Filter the option set A to F = {a ∈ A | constraints satisfied}.
Per‑option scoring: For each a ∈ F, compute the continuous guardrailed score Ψ(a) from its S(a), N(a), risks r(a), and β.
MCDA (preferences across criteria): Build a criteria vector c(a) = [Ψ(a), cost(a), value(a), time(a), …], choose a monotone MCDA aggregator M(c, w) (e.g., weighted sum/AHP‑derived weights/TOPSIS), and pick argmax M.
Key point: Fixing the structure of Ψ does not make Ψ discrete; the discreteness comes from the action set. Ψ remains a continuous criterion that MCDA uses alongside others.
Where earlier results still matter (and when they don’t)
If the MCDA aggregator M is strictly increasing in Ψ holding other criteria fixed, then:
Gauge freedom (parameter renames) leaves Ψ values unchanged → MCDA ranks unchanged.
Threshold transfer (β→β′ with τ′ = τ·β/β′ in sub‑cap) preserves accept/reject sets and hence MCDA feasibility; ranks unchanged where Ψ moves by a positive scalar factor in sub‑cap.
Sensitivity invariants (signs/zeros of ∂Ψ) imply predictable MCDA movement when only Ψ changes.
If M mixes Ψ non‑monotonically (e.g., penalizes large Ψ beyond a band) or couples Ψ with other criteria in non‑monotone ways, invariance can break. Then MCDA design, not Ψ, is the cause of rank flips.
Minimal formal statement
Theorem (MCDA invariance under monotone use of Ψ): Let M(c, w) be strictly increasing in the Ψ coordinate. If Ψ and Ψ′ are gauge‑equivalent (or related by sub‑cap threshold transfer), then for any two feasible options a, b with other criteria fixed, sign(M(c(a), w) − M(c(b), w)) is unchanged when Ψ is replaced by Ψ′. Hence the MCDA ranking by M is invariant.
Proof sketch: Strict monotonicity means M’s ordering matches Ψ’s ordering when other coordinates are fixed. Gauge freedom yields identical Ψ; threshold transfer scales Ψ by a positive factor in sub‑cap, preserving order.
