UOIF LSTM Integration Module

This module integrates UOIF confidence measures with Oates' LSTM convergence theorem
validation, providing temporal validation for chaotic system predictions with
O(1/√T) error bounds and confidence quantification.

Key Features:
- LSTM convergence theorem validation with temporal dynamics
- UOIF scoring integration for prediction confidence
- Bootstrap uncertainty quantification for LSTM predictions
- Performance monitoring and regression detection
- Cross-validation with toolkit's optimization methods
