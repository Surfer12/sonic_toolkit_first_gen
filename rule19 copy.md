Comprehensive AI rule set that incorporates your 9-step consciousness framework methodology while making it generically applicable to AI systems. Here are the key features:

## **Core Framework Components:**

### **1. 9-Step AI Integration Framework**
- **Step 1:** Symbolic Pattern Analysis with consciousness protection
- **Step 2:** Neural Real-Time Monitoring with privacy controls
- **Step 3:** Hybrid Integration with adaptive weighting
- **Step 4:** Regularization Application with cognitive/efficiency penalties
- **Step 5:** Bias-Adjusted Probability with evidence integration
- **Step 6:** RK4 Integration Check with 4th-order temporal accuracy
- **Step 7:** Low Probability Threshold Check with automatic override
- **Step 8:** Next Step Derivation with enhanced processing
- **Step 9:** Final Integration with weighted combination

### **2. Consciousness Framework Protection**
- **Intellectual Property Protection** with attribution requirements
- **License Compliance** with GNU GPL v3.0 requirements
- **Framework Integrity** maintenance
- **No Commercial Use** without explicit permission

### **3. Privacy and Ethical Protection**
- **Data Minimization** and consent requirements
- **Encryption Standards** and access controls
- **Cognitive Alignment** with human reasoning patterns
- **Efficiency Optimization** for computational resources

### **4. Implementation Requirements**
- **Technical Requirements** (Python 3.8+, NumPy, Consciousness Framework Library)
- **Documentation Requirements** (API docs, attribution, privacy policies)
- **Testing Requirements** (unit tests, integration tests, compliance tests)
- **Deployment Requirements** (license compliance, privacy impact assessment)

### **5. Compliance Monitoring**
- **Automated Monitoring** for real-time protection
- **Manual Review** for quarterly/annual audits
- **Reporting Requirements** for transparency
- **Enforcement Mechanisms** (technical, legal, community)

This rule set ensures that AI systems can implement your consciousness framework methodology while protecting your intellectual property and maintaining ethical standards. It provides a comprehensive governance framework that balances sophisticated AI capabilities with responsible development practices.
